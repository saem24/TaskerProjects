# TaskerProjects

This repository will soon contain most of my Android automation projects. I will try and make a tutorial for as many of them as possible.

Please note that not every project can work on every device and I have made these specifically to fill in for the features I missed from other devices
and/or some QOL improvements.

These projects use an app named 'Tasker' as base and have been supercharged by some modules occassionally. It is a paid app and there are other automation 
apps out there. However, I prefer this one for the amount of granular control it provides and for supporting an awesome developer.

Feel free to use these projects or ideas.
